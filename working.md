## Vulnerable Paths

### Unvalidated Redirect

Vuln JSON: [unvalidated-redirect.json](./vulns/unvalidated-redirect.json)

Discover:

- https://localhost:5001/
- Navigate to "LOGIN"
- Click "Register as a new user" (notice `returnUrl=%2F` in the browser URL)
- Fill out with valid email and password (6+ characters, one non-alpha, one lowercase, one uppercase, ugh)
- Click "Register" button
- Check logs for `unvalidated-redirect`

Exploit:

- https://localhost:5001/Identity/Account/Register?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com
